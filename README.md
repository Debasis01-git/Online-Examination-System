# Online-Examination-System
This Project Is Made By Using C Programming Language(standard ANSI C, file handling, structure, arrays, strings & character handling, timers, conditional logic, loops, cross platform support, randomization, input validation, summary report generation, admin panel result saving)

It is unique because: 
                     1. I add shuffling system to shuffle the questions and option because in case if two students are sitting near each other there is a chance of cheating which will be prevented by my shuffling code.Therefore no students can cheat.
                     2. There is also a negative marking system.
                     
It is a C-based computerized examination system that automates MCQ tests. It features a timer, randomized questions, shuffled options, negative marking, result analysis, and an admin panel for managing the question bank. The system uses file handling and real-time input to provide an efficient and interactive exam experience.
